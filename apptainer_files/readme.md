# apptainer_files
Houses Apptainer def files which can be used to build Apptainer images for various uses.

Each def file should be placed in its own subdirectory, named to indicate what software is included in the def file. In each subdirectory, a readme describing what the image is, what it is intended to be used for, and how to build it should be included.

An example of how to run a job using an apptainer on the UW HPC is included in `example_submit_script.sh`. CHTC also has a short guide [here](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/apptainer-hpc).
